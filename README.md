Certainly! Here is a detailed project description for the Vaccine Uptake Prediction project:

Vaccine Uptake Prediction
Project Description
Overview
The goal of this project is to predict the likelihood that individuals will receive two types of vaccines: the XYZ flu vaccine and the seasonal flu vaccine. Using demographic and behavioral data, we aim to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict these probabilities. The predictions will be evaluated using the ROC AUC metric for each target variable.

Objectives
Predict the probability of individuals receiving the XYZ flu vaccine.
Predict the probability of individuals receiving the seasonal flu vaccine.
Evaluate the model using ROC AUC for each target variable and calculate the mean ROC AUC as the overall performance metric.
Dataset
The dataset consists of the following files:

training_set_features.csv: Contains 35 feature columns and the respondent_id.
training_set_labels.csv: Contains the labels (xyz_vaccine, seasonal_vaccine) and the respondent_id.
test_set_features.csv: Contains the same 35 feature columns as the training set, along with the respondent_id.
submission_format.csv: Provides the format for the submission file.
Features
The dataset includes demographic, behavioral, and opinion-based features. Some key features are:

Demographics: Age group, education level, race, sex, income level, marital status, employment status, etc.
Behavioral: Use of antiviral medications, avoidance behaviors, mask usage, handwashing frequency, social distancing, etc.
Health-related: Presence of chronic medical conditions, health worker status, health insurance status, etc.
Opinions: Opinions about the effectiveness and risks of the XYZ and seasonal flu vaccines.
Target Variables
The target variables are:

xyz_vaccine: Whether the respondent received the XYZ flu vaccine (binary: 0 = No, 1 = Yes).
seasonal_vaccine: Whether the respondent received the seasonal flu vaccine (binary: 0 = No, 1 = Yes).
Methodology
Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values using imputation.
Encode categorical variables using one-hot encoding.
Scale numerical features for normalization.
Data Splitting:

Split the data into training and validation sets to evaluate the model's performance.
Model Training:

Use a RandomForestClassifier within a MultiOutputClassifier to handle multilabel classification.
Construct a pipeline to streamline preprocessing and model training.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model using ROC AUC for each target variable.
Calculate the mean ROC AUC to get the overall performance score.
Predictions and Submission:

Predict probabilities for the test set.
Prepare the submission file in the required format for evaluation.
Results
ROC AUC for xyz_vaccine: 0.832
ROC AUC for seasonal_vaccine: 0.852
Mean ROC AUC: 0.842
These results indicate that the model performs well in predicting the likelihood of individuals receiving the vaccines.

Conclusion
This project successfully developed a predictive model for vaccine uptake using a variety of features. The model achieved a mean ROC AUC score of 0.842, demonstrating good predictive performance. Future work could involve hyperparameter tuning, feature engineering, and exploring other machine learning algorithms to further improve the model's accuracy.
